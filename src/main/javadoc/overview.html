<p>Turtle logo is an introduction to computer programming. We imagine that we are working with a turtle that is
    holding a pen &mdash; presumably in its mouth. As the turtle roams around its terrarium, it drags the pen, leaving
    tracks wherever it goes.</p>

<h3>Sample Program</h3>

<p>A simple example of a program to control a turtle might look something like this:</p>

<pre>
import org.gannacademy.cdf.turtlelogo.*;

public class DrawASquare{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Turtle cecil = new Turtle(); // instantiate a new turtle

    // give the turtle some instructions
    cecil.fd(100);
    cecil.lt(90);
    cecil.fd(100);
    cecil.lt(90);
    cecil.fd(100);
    cecil.lt(90);
    cecil.fd(100);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The output of this program would be:</p>
